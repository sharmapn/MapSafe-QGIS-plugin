MapSafe qgis geoprivacy plugin
================




Our proposed MapSafe QGIS geoprivacy plugin furnishes a complete approach for safeguarding,
sharing, and verifying geospatial datsets from within the familiar QGIS
desktop application. Data owners can perform multiple geospatial data safeguarding
functions (geomasking or hexabinning, encryption, and notarization), along with verification
features, using their desktop application by themselves, eliminating reliance
on a third party for dataset protection. These features are demonstrated in a 5-minute
YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq4wX3kMTfE) and on the online
help menu at https://sharmapn.github.io/MapSafeQGISGeoPrivPlugin/

Plugin version 1.0 and above can only be used in QGIS version 3.
